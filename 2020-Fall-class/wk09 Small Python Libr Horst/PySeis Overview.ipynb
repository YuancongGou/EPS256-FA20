    ">**Horst Rademacher, Berkeley Seismology Laboratory**\n",
    "                                            (as of 27 Oct 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read SEED**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Read, print file header and plot complete SEED file. Assumption: file contains three component data, hence three traces. Select time window for further analysis, plot seismogram of that time window and write a new file containing only the selected section of the original file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Merge Files**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Allows merging two continguous files into one new one containing data sets from both original files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read Files Q8**\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Quanterra Q8 write data in unique mini-SEED files. Each is 4MByte long, with the followoing naming convention *BK-BK63-20200613151519.330* where BK is the network code, BK63 is the station name and the rest depicts the last the time at which the file was written. \n",
    "\n",
    ">This module reads those files and lists all traces containes therein. It then lets you select specific traces and plots them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot Record Section**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Plot a record section of seismograms sorted by distance. Also allows to plot with reduced velocity to highlight certain seismic phases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Horiz Rot**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Allows to rotate the N/S- and E/W-compoents into any direction within the horizontal plane, i.e. into radial (R) and transversal (T) directions. Currently does not allow 3D rotation including the incidience angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trace Overlay**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Read the files containing the streams and traces you wish to compare\n",
    "\n",
    ">Plot overlay traces for each component\n",
    "\n",
    ">Includes a short sub-module for downsampling a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seis Comparison**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Variation of module Trace Overlay, without Donwsampling but with establishing a cross correlation matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Diff Int**\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this module I compute and plot the time derivative and the integral over time of a seismic time series. Goal: compare the recordings of accelerometers with broadband seismometers. This also lets you create displacement seismograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part Motion**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Generate the particle motion in various planes from a displacement seismogram\n",
    "\n",
    "**ACC Flip Test**\n",
    "\n",
    ">This module allows the evaluation of a typical flip test of accelerometers. Print out the results in \"g\" for each component\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calib Q8**\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this module I can plot and evaluate the sine wave calibrations for broadband instruments. Plots overlays of injected signal over response signals of the three components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make PAZ (Poles and Zeroes)**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Generate a set of poles and zeroes from two values: lower corner period and damping. Allows comparison plots of variations of either damping or of corner periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transfer Fct**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Use a given set of poles and zeroes to plot the amplitude transfer function, including determining the 3 dB point of the lower period. Does not yet contain plotting of the phase response. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Galperin Conv**\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this module I convert the Z,N,E output of a seismometer with Galperin topology, also known as _homogeneous triaxial arrangement_ and used i.e. in the STS-2 series and the Nanometrics Trillium family, back to the original U,V,W traces of the three internal sensors. It also gives the option to re-convert from U,V,W to Z,N,E. This module contains only the conversion matrix for the STS-2 and not for the Trillium family of instruments. It also should not be used with the output of seismometers with a classical topology, where the three internal sensor are orthogonally arranged along the cardinal directions Z,N,E (i.e. STS-1, Guralp 3T or MBB-2).\n"
